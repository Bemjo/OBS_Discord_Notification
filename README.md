# OBS_Discord_Notification
A script for OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) that can poll Twitch.tv and post a notice through a Discord Webhook 

Note: Don't use this, it was made to brush up on my python skills, to learn about creating an API interface to existing services, and how to make a python script.
It is VERY inflexible, and may break without warning due to API changes to these services, and the APIs I created for those services being private to this project and NEVER being updated.
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK, BUT PLEASE DON'T USE IT AT ALL!

If you wish to learn about OBS scripting with python than this can be a source to explore.

Requirements:
Python 3
OBS setup for your python install so it can run python scripts
Requests package https://pypi.org/project/requests/: python -m pip install requests
